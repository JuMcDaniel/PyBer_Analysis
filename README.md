# PyBer_Analysis

The purpose of this newest analysis is to determine the amounts of fares received over the weeks to compare rural, suburban, and urban areas.  Overall to determine metrics comparing city types and average fare per ride and driver.  

The biggest differences between the types of cities is that urban overall has more rides; however has lower average fare per ride and a lot less of average fair per driver.  Rural data has the highest average fare per driver at $55.49; however only has 125 total rides over a three-month period.  The graph demonstrates the total fare by city type and demonstrates per month that rural overall has the most overall fares due to the increased number of rides.

Overall the data shows that rural communities produce increased number of rides and total fair number, but with the most drivers also produces the least amount of fare per driver.  Rural areas are much less with amount of rides and drives; however the highest revenue for the driver per fare.  With having a smaller average fare per driver in urban areas there may be difficulties with recruiting new drivers.
